  <h2 id="summary">1. Summary — What this policy says in brief</h2>
  <p>PDF Toolkit is a local-only file processing application. The App performs all PDF conversions and utility functions on the user's device, does not upload or transmit your PDF files, images, or content to any external servers, and does not collect or store personally identifiable information (PII), usage analytics, advertising identifiers, or tracking data. If you prefer a short checklist:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No personal data collection.</li>
    <li>No file uploads to our servers.</li>
    <li>No analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs are included.</li>
    <li>All processing occurs locally on your device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="definitions">2. Definitions</h2>
  <p>The following definitions apply in this Privacy Policy:</p>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Personal Data (or Personal Information)</strong></dt>
    <dd>Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. In the context of this App, Personal Data could include names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any content of files that identify a person.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Processing</strong></dt>
    <dd>Any operation performed on data, whether or not by automated means, including collection, storage, alteration, retrieval, or erasure.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Local Processing</strong></dt>
    <dd>Processing that takes place entirely on the user's device without transmitting data to remote servers.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Non-Personal Technical Data</strong></dt>
    <dd>Aggregate or anonymized technical information about device type, operating system version, or crash logs that cannot be linked to any particular individual. Unless explicitly stated, this App does not collect such data.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2 id="scope">3. Scope and applicability</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the PDF Toolkit mobile app distributed through app stores and any official websites, landing pages, or distribution channels maintained by the App developer. It applies to all users of the App regardless of country or residence. Where local law requires specific or additional disclosures, those are addressed in the Compliance section below.</p>

  <h2 id="data-collection">4. Information we collect</h2>
  <p>Short answer: None. The App is intentionally designed not to collect any user data. The remainder of this section explains that statement in detail and describes edge cases and given configurations.</p>

  <h3>4.1 No Personal Data Collection</h3>
  <p>PDF Toolkit does not request, collect, transmit, or store any personal data from users. The App's operation is limited to reading files that the user explicitly opens on their device and performing transformations entirely locally. The App does not request access to contact lists, calendars, call logs, SMS messages, or other personal data stores. Where the operating system requires permission for local file access (for example, access to device storage or media), such permissions are used solely to enable the user to select files to process and are not transmitted or shared.</p>

  <h3>4.2 No File Uploads or Backups</h3>
  <p>The App does not upload files to any remote service by default. Files remain on the user's device unless the user deliberately exports or shares an output file using the system's share or export functionality (for example, sharing via email, cloud storage apps, or other apps on the device). When a user chooses to share a file using another app or cloud service, that transfer happens between the user's device and the chosen third-party app or service; PDF Toolkit does not broker or log such transfers.</p>

  <h3>4.3 Permissions required by the App</h3>
  <p>To operate, the App may request the following permissions depending on the device and operating system version:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Storage / Files and media access:</strong> Required so users can select and save files. Used only for local file access; no content is transmitted externally.</li>
    <li><strong>Microphone (optional):</strong> If the App includes a speech-to-text feature, microphone permission may be required to capture audio input for immediate local transcription. The audio is processed locally; no audio is uploaded.</li>
    <li><strong>Camera (optional):</strong> If the App includes a document scanning feature that lets users take photos, camera permission may be requested. Images captured via the camera are stored locally or used immediately for conversion into PDF files; they are not uploaded by default.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All permissions are optional and requested only when the user initiates a feature that requires them. Users may deny permissions and still use non-dependent features of the App.</p>

  <h3>4.4 Analytics, Crash Reporting, and Advertising SDKs</h3>
  <p>PDF Toolkit does not include analytics SDKs, advertising SDKs, or crash-reporting services that collect user-level data. If you (the developer) later choose to integrate any such services, this policy will be updated and users will be notified. The updated policy will explain the data collected by those services and offer opt-out or consent mechanisms as required by law and the relevant app store policies.</p>

  <h2 id="local-processing">5. Local device processing — how the App works</h2>
  <p>This section is intended to provide an in-depth technical explanation of how the App processes files locally so that privacy officers, app reviewers, and concerned users can understand the privacy-preserving design.</p>

  <h3>5.1 File selection and access</h3>
  <p>When a user chooses to open a file, the App requests access to the file using the operating system's native file picker APIs. The file picker grants the App permission to read (and if required, write) the selected file or files. The App opens the file using read-only or temporary-writable streams in memory or in a local file cache. The App does not retain references to files beyond the lifetime necessary for processing unless the user explicitly saves an output file.</p>

  <h3>5.2 Processing pipeline</h3>
  <p>Each feature (for example, merge, split, convert PDF to image, or image to PDF) operates as a local pipeline of operations:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Input:</strong> The user selects one or more source files.</li>
    <li><strong>Processing:</strong> The App loads the required file bytes into memory or a local temporary file and runs the transformation using in-app libraries or native code. All operations are performed inside the App's sandbox on the device.</li>
    <li><strong>Output:</strong> The App produces an output file stored in local app storage or a user-selected location via the save/export workflow. The App does not transmit the output file to any external servers.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>5.3 Speech-to-text and text-to-speech</h3>
  <p>If the App includes speech features, the following applies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Text-to-Speech (TTS):</strong> Converts text content to audio locally using the device's TTS engine, when available. The App does not send text to external services for TTS unless the user chooses an optional cloud TTS provider (see Third-Party Services below) and consents.</li>
    <li><strong>Speech-to-Text (STT):</strong> If STT runs locally (using OS-provided or bundled models), audio captured by the microphone is processed on-device and converted into text. If the App offers a cloud-based STT option, the user will be asked to provide explicit consent before any audio is sent to a remote service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5.4 Caching and temporary files</h3>
  <p>The App may create temporary files for processing efficiency. These temporary files are stored in the App's local storage and are periodically or immediately deleted after processing completes. The App does not maintain long-term backups of user files unless the user explicitly uses a "save" or "export" action to store the result in a chosen location.</p>

  <h2 id="third-parties">6. Third-party services and libraries</h2>
  <p>PDF Toolkit is distributed using a minimal set of third-party libraries strictly for local file handling, rendering, or UI components. The libraries used do not send user files or personal data to remote servers by default. Examples include open-source PDF parsing or rendering libraries that perform processing inside the app runtime.</p>

  <h3>6.1 When a third-party service may be involved</h3>
  <p>There are limited scenarios where a third-party service could be involved, but they require explicit user action and consent:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sharing or exporting:</strong> When a user shares an output file using a cloud storage app (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) or email, the transfer is between the user's device and that service. The App does not intermediate or log the transfer.</li>
    <li><strong>Optional cloud features:</strong> If the App offers optional cloud-based OCR, STT, or TTS features in a future version, users will be presented with a clear consent request and an explanation of what data will be sent and how it will be processed. Those features will be disabled by default and clearly documented in the policy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6.2 Third-party SDKs we do not use</h3>
  <p>To be explicit and transparent, at the time of this policy the App does not integrate with the following categories of SDKs or services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Analytics SDKs (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics)</li>
    <li>Advertising networks or ad SDKs</li>
    <li>Behavioral or cross-app trackers</li>
    <li>Crash reporting platforms that collect device identifiers or user content</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="cookies">7. Cookies and equivalent technologies</h2>
  <p>PDF Toolkit is a native mobile application and does not use browser cookies. The App does not use local or remote tracking tokens, advertising IDs, or similar persistent identifiers for tracking purposes. The only identifiers used are those automatically and temporarily assigned by the operating system for basic sandboxing and permission management; these identifiers are not collected or transmitted by the App.</p>

  <h2 id="security">8. Security and data handling practices</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable steps to ensure that the App does not leak or expose user files beyond the user's device. Key practices include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Processing files in-app within the OS sandbox.</li>
    <li>Using secure temporary storage and ensuring temporary files are deleted promptly.</li>
    <li>Requesting only the minimal permissions necessary to operate requested features.</li>
    <li>Providing clear instructions to users about safe file handling and sharing practices.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>8.1 Limitations</h3>
  <p>No technical measure can guarantee absolute security. Although the App is designed to operate locally, the security of files also depends on the device's security posture, OS updates, and other installed apps. Users should keep their devices updated and use device-level security controls (screen lock, encryption, secure backup) to reduce risks.</p>

  <h2 id="user-rights">9. User rights and choices</h2>
  <p>Because PDF Toolkit does not collect or store personal data, many of the typical data subject rights (for example, requests to access or delete data) are not applicable. This section explains how users should interpret rights in the context of a local-only app.</p>

  <h3>9.1 If you wish to confirm we hold no data</h3>
  <p>Users may contact the developer using the contact details in this policy to request confirmation that the App, as distributed, does not collect or store personal data. We will respond to such requests and provide information about the App's data handling practices.</p>

  <h3>9.2 If you used optional features that involve third parties</h3>
  <p>If the App is updated in the future to include optional cloud features and you opt in, you will have the rights and options described in the relevant addendum (for example, ability to request deletion of data stored by that cloud provider). Each such feature will include a clear explanation of how to exercise rights and who is the data controller.</p>

  <h2 id="international">10. International and cross-border issues</h2>
  <p>PDF Toolkit is distributed internationally. Because the App processes files locally, it does not transfer personal data across borders. Where optional cloud features are introduced in the future, any cross-border data transfers will be described in the feature-specific documentation and will comply with applicable local laws and internationally recognized safeguards where required.</p>

  <h2 id="compliance">11. Regulatory compliance</h2>
  <p>This section describes how the App's no-collection approach aligns with major privacy laws. It is informational and does not constitute legal advice.</p>

  <h3>11.1 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) — European Economic Area</h3>
  <p>Under GDPR, the definition of "processing" includes any operation performed on personal data. Because PDF Toolkit does not collect or process personal data as distributed, typical GDPR obligations (lawful basis, data controller registration, data protection impact assessments) do not apply to personal data processing by the App. However, if the App is updated to include cloud features, a lawful basis and appropriate safeguards will be put in place. Users in the EEA retain all statutory rights; if a future feature collects data, those rights will be supported.</p>

  <h3>11.2 California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and CPRA</h3>
  <p>Under CCPA and CPRA, "personal information" is broadly defined. PDF Toolkit does not collect personal information from California residents. If the App begins collecting personal information in the future, the policy and in-app disclosures will be updated to enable data subject requests such as deletion and access.</p>

  <h3>11.3 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</h3>
  <p>COPPA applies to the online collection of personal information from children under 13. PDF Toolkit does not knowingly collect personal information from children. The App is not targeted specifically at children. If the App encourages users under the applicable age, or if optional cloud services are introduced that collect data, parental consent mechanisms will be implemented where required by law.</p>

  <h3>11.4 Other jurisdictions</h3>
  <p>Many jurisdictions have privacy or data protection laws (for example, Brazil's LGPD, Canada's PIPEDA, Australia's Privacy Act). Our approach of performing processing on-device minimizes legal exposure in these regimes. Where localized requirements exist and the App introduces server-side features, we will adopt compliance measures appropriate to each jurisdiction.</p>

  <h2 id="children">12. Children's privacy</h2>
  <p>PDF Toolkit is not designed for use by children. The App does not target users under the applicable minimum age and does not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that personal information has been collected from children in violation of this policy, we will take steps to delete that information promptly.</p>

  <h2 id="changes">13. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes that affect the privacy posture of the App (for example, introducing optional cloud storage or analytics), we will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Post the updated policy with a new "Last updated" date;</li>
    <li>Provide in-app notices describing the changes;</li>
    <li>Obtain user consent where required by law before enabling any new data collection features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="contact">14. Contact information</h2>

  </p>

  <h2 id="appendix">15. Appendix: Feature-by-feature technical notes</h2>
  <p>The following subsection provides practical technical notes about each feature to make clear how privacy is preserved during normal use. These notes are written so that auditors or privacy reviewers can confirm that the App's behavior is local-only.</p>

  <h3>15.1 Merge PDF</h3>
  <p>When merging PDF files, the App opens each source PDF in a read-only stream, copies page objects into a new in-memory PDF document, and writes the resulting PDF to local storage. No source or destination files are transmitted externally. Temporary copies made for processing are deleted after the operation completes.</p>

  <h3>15.2 Split PDF</h3>
  <p>Splitting works similarly: source pages are extracted and written to new PDF files locally. The App may offer a preview; previews are generated from local file data.</p>

  <h3>15.3 Rotate PDF / Add Page Numbers / Add Watermark / Delete Pages</h3>
  <p>These are transformations applied in-memory or to temporary files, and final files are saved locally only when the user confirms the save location.</p>

  <h3>15.4 PDF to JPG / JPG to PDF</h3>
  <p>Image rendering and encoding are performed locally. Users who share or upload resulting images to cloud services do so using the system's share sheet; the App does not manage or log those transfers.</p>

  <h3>15.5 Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text (TTS / STT)</h3>
  <p>If the App uses the device's built-in TTS or STT engines, then conversion is performed locally using the device's capabilities. If cloud-based STT/TTS is offered as an option, it will be opt-in and accompanied by clear disclosures and consent flow.</p>

  <h3>15.6 QR Code Generator / Password Generator / Utilities</h3>
  <p>Small utility features that generate QR codes, passwords, or compute hashes operate purely locally and do not send generated values to external services.</p>

  <h3>15.7 Other utilities</h3>
  <p>Utilities such as unit converters, lorem ipsum generators, random number, dice & coin, word counter, case converter, URL encoder, markdown preview, HTML playground, JSON formatter, and others are purely local features implemented within the App and do not communicate externally.</p>

  <h2 id="legal">16. Legal disclaimers and limitations</h2>
  <p>The following legal statements are provided for clarity and to reduce ambiguity. They do not replace counsel and are not legal advice.</p>

  <h3>16.1 No warranty</h3>
  <p>The App and this Privacy Policy are provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We do not warrant that the App will be free from defects, nor do we guarantee privacy beyond the design described here. Users are responsible for how they use the App and how they share output files.</p>

  <h3>16.2 Limitation of liability</h3>
  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, the developer is not liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from the use of the App, including any loss of data or privacy that results from the user's actions or third-party integrations outside the App's control.</p>

  <h3>16.3 Governing law</h3>
  <p>This policy and any dispute arising out of the App's data practices are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the developer is established, unless otherwise required by local law. If you would like to know the governing jurisdiction, contact us using the details above.</p>

  <h2 id="faq">17. Frequently asked questions (FAQ)</h2>
  <h3>Q: Does PDF Toolkit upload my files to the internet?</h3>
  <p>A: No. The App processes files on your device. Files are only uploaded if you explicitly choose to share or export them using other apps or cloud services on your device.</p>

  <h3>Q: Will you ever add analytics or ads?</h3>
  <p>A: Currently, the App does not include analytics or advertising SDKs. If we decide to add them in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy and provide opt-in/opt-out mechanisms as required.</p>

  <h3>Q: I found a bug — it caused the App to crash. Do you collect crash logs?</h3>
  <p>A: The released App does not include crash reporting that collects user-level or file-level data. If we integrate crash reporting in the future, the exact information collected will be disclosed in an updated policy and made available for review. We may ask you to optionally and explicitly send a diagnostic report to help us debug; such submissions would be at your choice and may contain parts of the file involved only if you include them in the report.</p>

  <h3>Q: What if I want my data removed?</h3>
  <p>A: Because we do not store your personal data, there is nothing to delete on our side. If you have used an optional third-party feature (enabled by explicit opt-in) that stores data, refer to that feature's documentation to request deletion from the third-party provider. You may also contact us for assistance.</p>

  <h3>Q: Is the App open source?</h3>
  <p>A: No. If the App is open source, reviewers and security researchers can audit the source code to verify the local-only behavior described in this policy.</p>

  <h2 id="acknowledgements">18. Security best practices for users</h2>
  <p>While the App minimizes data exposure by processing locally, users are encouraged to follow basic device security practices to keep their files private:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use a secure device passcode or biometric lock.</li>
    <li>Keep your operating system and apps up to date.</li>
    <li>Be cautious when sharing files with third-party apps or cloud services.</li>
    <li>Uninstall unused apps and remove unnecessary device permissions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="final-notes">19. Final notes and developer commitments</h2>
  <p>We are committed to protecting user privacy through design choices and transparent communication. This Privacy Policy reflects our intent to operate PDF Toolkit as a privacy-preserving, local-only application. We will promptly notify users and update this policy if we change how the App handles user data or if we introduce features that involve third-party processing.</p>
